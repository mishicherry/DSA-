"""
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠn / 2âŒ‹ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Approach:
        1. Using Hash-Map: TC: O(N),   SC:O(N)
            -> Create a dictionary.
            -> Set result and maxCount to be 0.
            -> Iterate through the array.
            -> increment count by 1.
            -> Increment result by 1 if count > than maxCount.
            -> Set maxCount by taking max of count and maxCount
            -> Return result(res).
        
        2.Simple Solution:   TC: O(N),   SC:O(1)
            -> Set result and count to be 0.
            -> Iterate through the array.
            -> If count == 0. Set res = n
            -> Increament count by 1 when res = n otherwise decrement by -1
            -> Return result(res).
